## Introduction

The UNet architecture is a fully convolutional neural network that has proven effective in pixel-level image segmentation tasks. It consists of two parts: a contraction path that captures context and a symmetric expansion path that enables precise localization.

This project is designed for:
- Learning the UNet architecture for image segmentation
- Training the model on your own data
- Testing the model on new images

## Features
- Dataset preprocessing and augmentation
- Training with CUDA support for faster computation
- Model checkpointing to save the best model during training
- Evaluation and performance metrics on the test dataset
- Visualization of results including segmented images

## Requirements

To run this project, you'll need the following dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- CUDA (optional, for GPU acceleration)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV
